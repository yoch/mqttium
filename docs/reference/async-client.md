# `AsyncClient`

`AsyncClient` is the Stable, async-native MQTTium API. One instance belongs to
one asyncio event loop. It owns transport lifecycle, reader/writer work,
keepalive, reconnect, receipts, and application delivery; it does not create a
background thread.

## Stable state and callbacks

| Member | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | Current `ConnectionState` |
| `is_connected` | Whether the client is currently connected |
| `negotiated` | Broker-negotiated MQTT settings after CONNACK |
| `effective_client_id` | Requested or broker-assigned client identifier |
| `on_connect` | Sync or async callback after successful connection |
| `on_disconnect` | Sync or async callback for disconnection |
| `on_message` | Sync or async message callback |
| `on_publish` | Sync or async publish-completion callback |
| `auth_handler` | MQTT 5 enhanced-authentication handler |

Callbacks execute outside protocol-engine critical sections. Synchronous
`on_publish` and eligible `on_message` callbacks may execute inline when
callback delivery is idle; async, reentrant and queued callbacks use the
bounded worker. Synchronous callbacks must not block the event loop. Callback
failures go to the event loop's exception handler without silently changing
protocol state.

## Loop confinement

`publish_nowait()` and `stats()` are synchronous but must run on the owning
event-loop thread. They are not cross-thread methods. Use the Provisional Paho
facade only when an existing synchronous application needs a transition path.

## Constructor settings

Constructor keywords and Stable defaults are part of the public contract. The
generated signature above is authoritative for spelling and defaults;
[Configuration and Sizing](../configuration-and-sizing.md) groups them by responsibility
and explains how to choose values.

## Lifecycle pattern

```python
client = AsyncClient("service")
try:
    await client.connect("broker.example", 8883, ssl=True)
    # Subscribe, publish, and consume.
finally:
    await client.disconnect()
```

Keep `disconnect()` in `finally`. An application-owned persistence store is
closed after the client.

## Message iterator lifecycle

A `messages()` iterator belongs to one application-delivery generation. An
unexpected connection loss followed by automatic reconnect keeps that generation
alive, so an `async for` loop or suspended `anext()` continues on the replacement
transport.

A terminal disconnect ends the current generation. A later explicit `connect()`,
`connect_unix()`, or `connect_ws()` starts a new generation. Iterators created for
the previous generation stay terminal and cannot consume messages delivered by
the new connection; call `messages()` again after the explicit connect to consume
the replacement generation.
